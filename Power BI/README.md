# Power BI
As part of the ITI Business Intelligence Winter Trainer, I engaged in several lab exercises that allowed me to gain hands-on experience with different Power BI tools and technologies. Here are some of the highlights:

## Lab 1
- Lab 1 involved working with Kickstarter projects and CSV files, using Power Query to transform data and create custom columns with the M language. I developed a hierarchy, measures, and visuals to represent the data, including cards for the number of projects, backers, and total pledges, and charts for the number of projects by state and by category hierarchy.

## Lab 2
- Lab 2 involved working with the AdventureWorks database to learn about DirectQuery, establishing relationships between tables, measures, and DAX tables. I created a variety of visuals, including cards for the number of orders and total subtotals, tax, freight, and dues, and charts for the number of orders by status, ship method, and territory, and a chart of top 10 salespersons.

## Lab 3
- Lab 3 involved working with the Facebook Graph API and learned how to extract links and hashtags, create measures, and develop visuals to represent the data. I created a card for the number of posts, a chart for the number of posts by date, and a table displaying post details. At the end of the lab exercises, I had the opportunity to publish this project on Power BI Report Server.
