# Microsoft SQL server

I acquired a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and Database Management. Through the course, I was able to develop and enhance my skills in:
- creating databases using wizards
- generating DB diagrams
- modifying rows
- inserting rows into tables
- writing various queries to retrieve data from databases

The training program was a valuable and practical learning experience, which helped me to apply my knowledge of MS SQL in real-world scenarios, and challenged me to improve my skills in this area.
