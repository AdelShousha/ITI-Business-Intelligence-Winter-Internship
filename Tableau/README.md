# Tableau

For my Tableau project, I utilized the Airbnb New York dataset to analyze the relationship between the neighborhood group, room type, and various metrics including price, listing count, reviews, and availability. The dashboards were specifically designed to provide insights on how these factors influence each other, and to identify patterns and trends that can help in making data-driven decisions. By visualizing the data in an interactive and user-friendly way, the dashboards make it easier to understand complex information and to identify key insights that can be used to improve business performance. Overall, the project was a great learning experience, and I gained valuable skills in data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation using Tableau.
